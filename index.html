            <h2>The CraftedAura Story</h2>
            <p>
                CraftedAura began as a small woodshop in Delhi, founded by master carpenter Rajiv Mehta in 2010. What started as a passion project creating custom furniture for friends and family has grown into a renowned woodcraft studio known for its exceptional quality and distinctive designs. Our philosophy centers on three core principles: honoring the natural beauty of wood, preserving traditional craftsmanship techniques, and innovating with contemporary design. Each piece that leaves our workshop carries the mark of the artisan who created it - a signature of handcrafted excellence. We carefully select our materials, working with sustainable forestry operations and reclaimed wood sources to minimize environmental impact. The CraftedAura team now includes twelve skilled artisans specializing in different aspects of woodcraft, from intricate carving to structural joinery. Our work has been featured in design publications and luxury homes across India, but we remain committed to our roots - creating functional art that brings warmth and character to everyday life.

                <br><br>
                Regarding our handcrafted wood creations, due to the unique nature of natural wood and the artisanal process, each piece may exhibit slight variations in color, grain, and texture. These variations are inherent to handmade items and contribute to their individual character and beauty. We strive to accurately represent our products through images and descriptions; however, actual colors may vary slightly due to monitor settings and lighting conditions. Care instructions are provided with each product, and it is the customer's responsibility to follow these guidelines to maintain the longevity and quality of their purchase. CraftedAura is not responsible for damage resulting from improper care or misuse.
                <br><br>
                For our woodworking workshops, participants acknowledge that engaging in woodworking activities involves inherent risks. While we prioritize safety and provide guidance, participants are responsible for their own safety and adherence to instructions. CraftedAura is not liable for any injuries sustained during workshops or from the use of tools and materials provided. By participating, you agree to assume all risks associated with the activities. Proper safety equipment must be worn at all times in the workshop, and participants must demonstrate competency with tools before use.

                Concerning custom orders, while we make every effort to meet project timelines, handcrafted work may sometimes require adjustments to the schedule due to the nature of the materials and process. We will communicate any delays promptly. Custom pieces are non-refundable once production has begun, though we work closely with clients to ensure complete satisfaction with the design before construction starts. Final products may differ slightly from renderings due to the organic nature of wood and the handmade process.
